algorithms are steps of instructions describing how to complete a task such as solving a problem think about playing cards for example a computer scientist wants to sort the cards first he wants to sort them out by color then he wants to order them by number 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 jack queen king and ace the computer scientist may see different ways to sort the playing cards he must now think about of how he will do it when he decides he has created an algorithm after making the algorithm the scientist needs to test whether the algorithm always does what it should then the scientist can see how well his program sorts the cards
a simple but very slow algorithm could be drop the cards pick them up and check whether they are sorted if they are not do it again this method will work but it will often take a very long time
a person may do this better by looking through all the cards finding the first card 2 of diamonds and putting it at the start after this he looks for the second card and so on this works much faster and does not need much space this sorting algorithm is a selection sort
computer science began during world war ii and separated from the other sciences during the 1960s and 1970s Now computer science uses special methods of doing things and has its own special words it is related to electrical engineering mathematics and language science
computer science looks at the theoretical parts of computers computer engineering looks at the physical parts of computers hardware and software engineering looks at the use of computer programs and how to make them
