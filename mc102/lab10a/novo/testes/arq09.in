when a message is sent using cryptography it is changed or encrypted before it is sent the method of changing text is called a code or more precisely a cipher the changed text is called ciphertext the change makes the message hard to read someone who wants to read it must change it back or decrypt it how to change it back is a secret both the person that sends the message and the one that gets it should know the secret way to change it but other people should not be able to studying the cyphertext to discover the secret is called cryptanalysis or cracking or sometimes code breaking
different types of cryptography can be easier or harder to use and can hide the secret message better or worse ciphers use a key which is a secret that hides the secret messages the cryptographic method neednt be secret various people can use the same method but different keys so they cannot read each others messages since the caesar cipher has only as many keys as the number of letters in the alphabet it is easily cracked by trying all the keys ciphers that allow billions of keys are cracked by more complex methods
